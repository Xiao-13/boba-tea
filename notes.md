Notes
You will likely have some simple syrup left over, which you can refrigerate for 3 to 4 weeks. You can use any kind of sugar to make simple syrup, such as light or dark brown sugar or coconut sugar. I also like to infuse my syrup with ginger by adding a few slices of ginger to the saucepan as I make the syrup.
Typically, I leave the tea steeping the entire time so that the tea is strong and bitter. Otherwise, I find that the tea flavor is too faint when I add milk and ice cubes to the drink. Some tea leaves definitely have a stronger bitter flavor. Feel free to remove the tea bags or tea leaves after 5 minutes if you are concerned about the bitterness of the tea.
If you are making the pearls about an hour ahead, donâ€™t drain the pearls from the saucepan. Leave them in the hot water as the heat of the water will help keep the tapioca pearls soft.
